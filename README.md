# TaskTrackerAPI
This is a Internship Assignment

I have used the standered format of spring api applictaions for this API.

How to Run :

open the project in intellij or any ide you want.
change the application properties according to your system postgresql credentials.
Run the main spring application.
You can now check the API endpoints working via Postman.
Note : I have implemented all the requriments mention in assignment.

I have write the code in very clean manner which makes it easy to read.
